## General description: 
    These were some fun, simple programs I wrote to explore some Python packages that I was previously unfamiliar with. I moreover wanted to consider how Python can be employed 
    to automate practical, daily tasks. 
    I used the following tutorial as a guide for 'YT_video_download' & 'PDF_merger': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEQ8CXFWLZU
    and this tutorial as a guide for 'weather_API': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3W-LKfafE&t=2612s

### YouTube Video Download 
This program can be used to download a YouTube video to your device. It comes in handy if you want to be able to watch a particular video at a later time when you won't have 
internet access! 
I used the pytube library and created a YouTube object that requires a link to the video to be passed in as an arg. 
After getting the highest resolution stream for that video, I downloaded it to my 'Downloads' folder on my mac.
